Block-level Element:
    • An HTML element that always starts on a new line.
    • It takes up the full width available (the entire width of its parent container).
    • Can contain both block-level and inline elements inside it.
    • Commonly used to create the main structure of the webpage.
    • Browsers add a line break before and after block-level elements by default.
    
Examples:<div>, <p>, <h1>–<h6>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>, <header>, <footer>, <section>, <article>, <form>, <table>, <main>, <nav>, <figure>

Inline Element:
    • An HTML element that does not start on a new line; it flows inline with the surrounding content.
    • It only takes up as much width as its content requires.
    • Can only contain text or other inline elements (cannot contain block-level elements).
    • Used to style parts of text or small pieces inside a block element.
    
Examples:<span>, <a>, <strong>, <em>, <img>, <label>, <input>, <sub>, <sup>
📌 1. <div> (Division)
    • A block-level element → it takes up the entire line.
    • Used to group large sections of a webpage.
    • Mostly used in layout design.
Helpful for styling and structuring content.
📌 2. <span>
    • An inline element → it stays in line with text (doesn’t start a new line).
    • Used to style or group small parts of text.
Mostly used with CSS to change color, size, or font of text.
